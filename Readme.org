* malloc-uninitialized
** Why?
While malloc returns uninitialized memory, the operating system zeroes all memory given to the program (\*) for security reasons.
Therefore the first time malloc returns a certain block of memory, it is zeroed.
This can lead to uninitialized memory bugs to apparently jsut work fine.
This library changes that.

(\*) This is sometimes not true in embedded environments
** How
We wrap the system c library's malloc function with our own.
The block returned from malloc is then filled with random data from a cryptographic random number generator seeded from urandom.
** Portability
Linux only
** Build
With a recent rust toolchain installed run
#+begin_src
cargo build --release
#+end_src
in this repository
** Usage
add this library to the LD_PRELOAD env var like:
#+begin_src shell
LD_PRELOAD={path}/malloc-uninitialized.so {executable}
#+end_src
where ~path~ is the path where the library is located and ~execuatble~ is the executable you want to run.
